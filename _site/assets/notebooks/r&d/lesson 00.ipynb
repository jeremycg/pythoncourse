    "## Welcome to the Python course @ Precima\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully everyone has read the syllabus, cheat sheets and course outline on the website.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are available at www.jeremy.kiwi.nz/pythoncourse.\n",
    "\n",
    "All lessons are made as iPython notebooks and will be available on this site to download. Grab todays lesson from [this link!](/pythoncourse/assets/notebooks/r&d/lesson 00.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson I'll assume you either attended the Applied Stream intro to data types lecture, or have read it through [from the website](http://jeremy.kiwi.nz/pythoncourse/2016/02/09/lesson00applied.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we will briefly go over course logistics and the Anaconda environment and then dive into Python statements and functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a programming language first released in 1991 by Guido van Rossum and one of the most popular languages used in computing today. Python currently ranks as the [5th most common language used on github](https://github.com/blog/2047-language-trends-on-github). \n",
    "\n",
    "Python is used as a scripting language, as well as in web development and to create applications - some of the more popular websites and applications running at least partially on Python include: Google, Youtube, Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, Dropbox, Civilization IV, EVE Online and BitTorrent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python as a language is based on readability, flexibility, simplicity and extensibility. \n",
    "\n",
    "The extensibility of Python has caused it to be adopted, along with R, as one of the premier data science programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has had many added on modules (or libraries) added to it, to allow data science work which we will cover in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general compared to R, Python is faster, more programmer focussed and less restrictive in licensing. The downside is new statistical methods tend to appear in R before Python, although as the community grows, this has become less of a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Anaconda, iPython and Spyder\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use Anaconda, a distribution of Python by Continuum Analytics, put together for use in data science. \n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda comes with most of the modules we need for data analysis, as well as Jupyter notebooks, and the IDE we will use for the first couple of lessons, Spyder.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have installed the launcher, which allows updating and launching these apps, the Spyder IDE which allows coding and running scripts in an integrated environment, the iPython-QT console, which is an advanced console allowing inline graphing, and the iPython notebook, which allows development in interactive notebooks in the browser. These programs all run Python code - the difference is in how you interact with the environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "iPython notebooks are currently in the process of being rebranded into Jupyter notebooks - the launcher and documentation will refer to them interchangeably.\n",
    "\n",
    "Coding along with the lesson is encouraged! \n"

    "### 2.7 vs 3\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2008, Python version 3.0 was released. Due to the number and nature of changes, Python 2.6 and Python 3.0 were not compatible. This has lead to a split in the Python community, as many users were unwilling to fix existing code to 3 compatibility, and have since continued to develop Python 2.6 into 2.7, while 3.0 has been developed in parallel and currently stands at version 3.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we will use Python 3. This is due to the majority of users having no legacy code to worry about, the better memory management, and the availability of the data science stack in Python 3. If you are a die hard Python 2.7 user, feel free to continue using it, although you will need to fix the code yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the level we will be coding at the changes are not too big, the largest differences we will see are `print()` vs `print`, `xrange` vs `range` and other generators. Python code found online will often be 2.7, but should be readable by a 3 trained user.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Course Logistics\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start by covering the basic data types and structures, move on to loops and statements, then functions and classes. In lessons 4 and 5 we will introduce the standard data  modules, Pandas and NumPy, then move on into graphing, code optimization and machine learning. Please let me know if you have any particular applications or problems, and we will try and address the common ones in class.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are tracking progress, to make sure this course is giving value for your time - Please make sure you answer the quizzes and assessments we will send out later in the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outside Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "A number of people have asked about text books or online resources for the course. Most Python tutorials online will assume a knowledge at around the level we will reach at the end of lesson 3. I'm using [Python for Data Analysis](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023784.do) for the numpy and pandas section - It won't be necessary to purchase but is a good book if a little outdated. For the other lessons, links will be provided to the relevant docs.\n",
